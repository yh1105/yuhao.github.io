I am a postdoctoral researcher at HKUST, working with Prof. Yuan Xie. My research interests are automated code generation (including hardware and software), with focuses on large language models, multimodal learning, and their applications in complex scenarios. I obtained Ph.D at Peking University, under the supervision of Tao Xie and Ying Li, master degree from Peking University, and bachelor from Tianjin Normal University.
