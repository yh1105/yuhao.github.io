I am a postdoctoral researcher at HKUST, working with Prof. Yuan Xie. My research interests are automated code generation, with focuses on hardware and software code generation. I obtained Ph.D at Peking University, under the supervision of Tao Xie and Ying Li, master degree from Peking University, and bachelor from Tianjin Normal University.
